## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/46d2181b-ace3-4886-b550-bc9746762717) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: (OPTIONAL) Set up Google OAuth for real Google sign-in
# See QUICK_SETUP.md for 5-minute setup guide
# Or use email/password or guest mode without setup

# Step 5: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## 🔐 Google Sign-In Setup

This app supports real Google OAuth authentication! To enable it:

1. **Quick Setup (5 min)**: See [QUICK_SETUP.md](QUICK_SETUP.md) for step-by-step instructions
2. **Detailed Guide**: See [GOOGLE_AUTH_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_AUTH_SETUP.md) for comprehensive setup

**Note**: Google sign-in is optional. You can also use:
- Email/password login (demo mode - any credentials work)
- Guest mode (no account needed)

Without Google OAuth setup, clicking "Continue with Google" will show a helpful error message with setup instructions.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
