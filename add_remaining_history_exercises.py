Understanding this shared immigrant heritage reminds us all Singaporeans descended from migrants, creating our multiracial foundation we celebrate through Racial Harmony Day.\n\n**Historical Immigration Background:**\n\n**Why They Came:**\n- **Chinese**: Escaping Taiping Rebellion, poverty, famine\n- **Indians**: Fleeing famines, seeking opportunities\n- **Malays**: From surrounding islands, seeking trade\n- **Everyone**: Looking for SURVIVAL and HOPE\n\n**What They Brought:**\n- Different languages (Hokkien, Tamil, Malay, English)\n- Different religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity)\n- Different customs (food, festivals, clothing)\n- Different social structures (clans, castes)\n\n**Early Challenges:**\n- Language barriers prevented communication\n- Cultural misunderstandings caused conflicts\n- Secret societies created violence between groups\n- Competition for jobs led to tensions\n- Segregation policies divided communities\n\n**Connection to Racial Harmony Day (July 21):**\n\n**1. Shared Origins:**\n- NO ONE is "more Singaporean" based on when ancestors arrived\n- ALL of us have immigrant roots\n- This creates EQUALITY - we're all descendants of migrants\n\n**2. Inherited Diversity:**\n- Our multiracial society wasn't planned - it HAPPENED\n- Immigration brought diversity\n- We CHOSE to embrace it rather than fight it\n\n**3. Hard-Won Harmony:**\n- Early Singapore had racial tensions and violence\n- 1964 Racial Riots showed what happens when harmony breaks\n- We LEARNED harmony isn't natural - requires WORK\n\n**4. Psychological Defence Connection:**\n- External forces may try to divide us along racial lines\n- Understanding shared immigrant struggle creates unity\n- "We're all in this together" mentality\n\n**Modern Application:**\n\n**Why Racial Harmony Day Matters:**\n- **Remembers**: 1964 riots (Muslims vs Chinese violence)\n- **Celebrates**: Our ability to overcome differences\n- **Reminds**: Harmony needs constant maintenance\n- **Teaches**: Younger generations value of diversity\n\n**Practical Lessons:**\n- Respect different cultures (all came with valid traditions)\n- Understand economic cooperation (ancestors worked together despite differences)\n- Appreciate today's peace (contrast with early violence)\n- Maintain vigilance (harmony can be fragile)\n\n**National Education Links:**\n- **No one owes Singapore a living**: All ancestors came to WORK and BUILD\n- **Must ourselves defend Singapore**: Includes defending racial harmony\n- **Regardless of race, language or religion**: Direct quote from Pledge, based on immigrant diversity\n\n**Tip**: History shows diversity can be source of STRENGTH (multiple trade networks) or CONFLICT (riots).

Safety from War (TRUE):**\n- No civil war (unlike Taiping Rebellion)\n- British rule provided stability\n- No famine (unlike China's agricultural crises)\n- This WAS a major pull factor\n\n**3.
