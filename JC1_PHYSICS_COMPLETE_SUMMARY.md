## 🔬 Sample Content Quality

### Example: Chapter 2 (Kinematics) - MRT Train Problem

**Question Context:**
"When an MRT train accelerates from Bishan station, it goes from rest to 20 m/s in 10 seconds."

**Comprehensive Solution:**
```
Initial velocity: u = 0 m/s (at rest)
Final velocity: v = 20 m/s
Time: t = 10 s

Acceleration: a = (v - u) / t = (20 - 0) / 10 = 2 m/s²
```

**Singapore Relevance:**
- Uses real MRT system
- Typical acceleration rates
- Connects to student daily experience
