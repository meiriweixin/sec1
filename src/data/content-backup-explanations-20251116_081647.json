COST CALCULATIONS\nTotal cost = Fixed cost + (Rate × Quantity)\ny = c + mx\n\nExample: Taxi fare in Singapore\ny = 3.50 + 0.50x\n• y = total fare ($)\n• x = distance (km)\n• m = 0.50 (rate per km)\n• c = 3.50 (base fare)\n\n2. CONVERSION FORMULAS\nExample: Temperature Fahrenheit to Celsius\nF = 1.8C + 32\n• m = 1.8 (conversion rate)\n• c = 32 (freezing point difference)\n\n3. PHONE PLANS\ny = Monthly fee + (Rate per minute × Minutes)\n\nExample: Plan costs $25/month + $0.10/minute\ny = 0.10x + 25\n\n4. SALARY WITH COMMISSION\nPay = Base salary + (Commission rate × Sales)\n\nExample: $2000/month + 5% of sales\ny = 0.05x + 2000\n\n5. WATER TANK FILLING/DRAINING\nVolume = Initial volume + (Rate × Time)\n\nExample: Tank starts with 500L, fills at 20L/min\ny = 20x + 500\n\nKEY SKILL: Identify what m and c represent in context!\n• m = rate of change (per unit)\n• c = starting value (when x = 0)",

              "content": "**Neutralization** is a chemical reaction between an acid and a base that produces salt and water.\n\n**General Formula:**\n```\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\n```\n\n**Example Reactions:**\n\n**1. Hydrochloric Acid + Sodium Hydroxide**\n```\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O\n(Acid + Base → Salt + Water)\n```\n- Products: Sodium chloride (table salt) + water\n- The solution becomes neutral (pH 7)\n\n**2. Sulfuric Acid + Magnesium Hydroxide**\n```\nH₂SO₄ + Mg(OH)₂ → MgSO₄ + 2H₂O\n```\n- Products: Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) + water\n- Used in antacid medicine!\n\n**3. Nitric Acid + Potassium Hydroxide**\n```\nHNO₃ + KOH → KNO₃ + H₂O\n```\n- Products: Potassium nitrate (fertilizer) + water\n\n**What Happens During Neutralization:**\n- H⁺ ions from acid + OH⁻ ions from base → H₂O (water)\n- The remaining ions form a salt\n- Heat is released (exothermic reaction)\n- pH moves toward 7 (neutral)\n\n**Real-Life Applications:**\n\n**1. Treating Stomach Acidity (Heartburn)**\n- Problem: Excess stomach acid (HCl) causes pain\n- Solution: Take antacid tablet (contains base like Mg(OH)₂)\n- Reaction: HCl + Mg(OH)₂ → MgCl₂ + H₂O\n- Result: Acid neutralized, pain relief\n\n**2. Treating Insect Stings**\n\n**Bee Sting** (acidic venom):\n- Apply baking soda paste (base)\n- Base neutralizes the acid\n- Reduces pain and swelling\n\n**Wasp Sting** (basic venom):\n- Apply vinegar (acid)\n- Acid neutralizes the base\n- Reduces pain and swelling\n\n**3. Agriculture - Soil Treatment**\n\n**Acidic Soil** (bad for some plants):\n- Add lime (calcium hydroxide - base)\n- Neutralizes excess acid\n- Improves plant growth\n\n**Basic Soil** (bad for other plants):\n- Add sulfur (forms acid when wet)\n- Neutralizes excess base\n- Better growing conditions\n\n**4. Industrial Waste Treatment**\n- Factory waste may be very acidic or basic\n- Add opposite substance to neutralize\n- Make waste safe before releasing to environment\n\n**5. Toothpaste**\n- Bacteria in mouth produce acids\n- Acids damage tooth enamel\n- Toothpaste contains mild bases\n- Neutralizes acids, protects teeth\n\n**Singapore Context:**\n\n**1. PUB Water Treatment**\n- Adjusts pH of water supply\n- Uses bases to neutralize acidic water\n- Ensures safe drinking water (pH ~7)\n\n**2. Swimming Pools**\n- Need to maintain pH 7.2-7.8\n- Add acid if too basic\n- Add base if too acidic\n- Keeps water safe and comfortable\n\n**3. Cooking**\n- If curry is too sour (acidic), add a pinch of baking soda (base)\n- Neutralizes excess acid\n- Balances flavor\n\n**Signs of Neutralization:**\n- Temperature increases (gets warmer)\n- Bubbling may occur\n- Color change if indicator present\n- pH moves toward 7",

The shadow has two regions:\n\n1. **Umbra** - The dark, inner shadow where all light is blocked\n2. **Penumbra** - The lighter, outer shadow where only some light is blocked\n\n**Example 1: Your Shadow in Singapore**\n\nAt noon in Singapore (near the equator), the sun is almost directly overhead, so your shadow is very short. In the early morning or late afternoon, the sun is lower, so your shadow is much longer.\n\nWhy? Light travels in straight lines from the sun. When the sun is high, light rays come almost straight down. When the sun is low, light rays come at an angle, creating a longer shadow.\n\n**Example 2: Solar Eclipse**\n\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking sunlight. Because light travels in straight lines:\n\n- The Moon casts a shadow on Earth\n- People in the umbra (dark central shadow) see a total solar eclipse\n- People in the penumbra (lighter outer shadow) see a partial solar eclipse\n- People outside the shadow see no eclipse\n\n**Singapore Context:**\nThe last time Singapore experienced a partial solar eclipse was on December 26, 2019. The next one will be visible on April 20, 2023. During an eclipse, scientists set up viewing stations at Singapore Science Centre with special solar filters.\n\n**Safety Note:** Never look directly at the sun, even during an eclipse! It can permanently damage your eyes.",

Aquarium (Sentosa), the fish appear closer to the glass than they actually are.\n\n**Why?**\n- Light from the fish travels through water, then through thick glass, then into air\n- Each time light crosses a boundary, it refracts\n- The fish's actual position is further back than where you see it\n- This is why it's hard to catch fish with your hands in water!\n\n**Example 4: Sunset Colors**\n\nDuring Singapore's beautiful sunsets over Marina Bay, the sun appears red/orange near the horizon.\n\n**Why?**\n- Sunlight refracts through Earth's atmosphere\n- Blue light scatters more than red light\n- At sunset, light travels through more atmosphere\n- Only red/orange light reaches your eyes\n- This creates stunning Singapore sunsets!\n\n**Practical Application:** Understanding refraction is crucial for:\n- Designing eyeglasses and contact lenses\n- Making camera lenses\n- Fiber optic cables (used in Singapore's ultra-fast internet)\n- Underwater photography",

Particles at the hot end vibrate faster (gain kinetic energy)\n3. These particles collide with neighboring particles\n4. Energy is transferred along the material from particle to particle\n5. The vibrations spread, transferring heat through the material\n\n**Good Conductors (conduct heat quickly):**\n- Metals: copper, aluminum, iron, steel\n- Why? Metals have free-moving electrons that transfer energy efficiently\n\n**Poor Conductors / Insulators (conduct heat slowly):**\n- Non-metals: wood, plastic, rubber, cloth, air\n- Why? Their particles are less able to transfer energy\n\n**Practical applications:**\n- Cooking pots made of metal (good heat conduction)\n- Pot handles made of plastic or wood (poor conduction prevents burns)\n- Winter clothes trap air (air is a poor conductor, keeps you warm)",

On a hot day, tile floors feel cool to bare feet even though the room is warm.\n\n**Why?**\n- Tiles are better conductors than air\n- Heat from your warm feet (37°C) conducts into the cooler tiles quickly\n- Your feet lose heat rapidly, making the tiles feel cool\n- The tiles are actually at room temperature, but they conduct heat away from your feet effectively\n\n**Example 5: Thermal Insulation**\n\nSingapore buildings use foam insulation in walls and air gaps in windows to keep interiors cool.\n\n**Why?**\n- Air is a poor conductor of heat\n- Foam contains trapped air bubbles\n- This reduces heat conduction from hot outdoor air (often 30-35°C) to air-conditioned interiors (23-25°C)\n- Result: Lower electricity bills for air conditioning!",

They're always installed high on the wall.\n\n**Why install AC high?**\n\nStep 1: AC blows out cold air\nStep 2: Cold air is denser and sinks down\nStep 3: Warm air near the floor becomes less dense and rises\nStep 4: Warm air reaches the AC unit and gets cooled\nStep 5: Convection currents circulate and cool the entire room\n\n**If AC was installed low:** Cold air would stay at floor level, warm air would remain near the ceiling, room wouldn't cool efficiently.\n\n**Example 3: Sea Breeze in Singapore**\n\nOn sunny days at East Coast Park or Sentosa, you feel a cool breeze from the sea.\n\n**How sea breeze forms:**\n\n**During the day:**\n1. Sun heats land faster than sea (land has lower heat capacity)\n2. Hot air above land rises (convection)\n3. Cooler air from the sea rushes in to replace it\n4. Result: Cool sea breeze blowing toward land\n\n**At night:**\n1. Land cools faster than sea\n2. Warmer air above sea rises\n3. Cooler air from land moves toward sea\n4. Result: Land breeze blowing toward sea (weaker than sea breeze)\n\n**Singapore context:** This is why coastal areas like Marine Parade feel cooler than central areas like Ang Mo Kio during hot afternoons.\n\n**Example 4: Thunderstorm Formation**\n\nSingapore experiences frequent afternoon thunderstorms, especially during the Southwest Monsoon (June-September).\n\n**How convection causes thunderstorms:**\n\n1. Intense tropical sun heats the ground\n2. Ground heats the air above it\n3. Hot, humid air rises rapidly (strong convection)\n4. Rising air cools as it goes higher\n5. Water vapor condenses, forming clouds\n6. If convection is strong enough, cumulonimbus (thunderstorm) clouds form\n7. Result: Heavy rain and thunder\n\n**Why afternoon storms?** The sun is strongest at midday, creating the most intense heating and convection by afternoon.\n\n**Example 5: Ceiling Fans**\n\nSingapore homes often have ceiling fans to improve comfort.\n\n**How ceiling fans use convection:**\n- Fans don't cool the air, but they create air movement\n- Moving air helps convection by mixing warm air near the ceiling with cooler air near the floor\n- This makes the room feel more comfortable\n- Fans also increase evaporation of sweat from your skin, making you feel cooler",

Pepsin** (in gastric juice)\n- Breaks down: Proteins\n- Produces: Smaller protein chains (polypeptides)\n- Location: Stomach\n- Needs: Acidic environment (pH 2)\n- Example foods: Meat, fish, eggs\n\n**3. Lipase** (in pancreatic juice)\n- Breaks down: Fats/lipids\n- Produces: Fatty acids and glycerol\n- Location: Small intestine\n- Helped by: Bile (emulsifies fats)\n- Example foods: Oil, butter, fatty meats\n\n**4. Trypsin** (in pancreatic juice)\n- Breaks down: Proteins\n- Produces: Amino acids\n- Location: Small intestine\n- Example foods: All protein-containing foods\n\n**Important properties of enzymes:**\n- Each enzyme is specific (amylase only works on starch, not protein)\n- Work best at specific pH levels (pepsin in acidic stomach, trypsin in alkaline small intestine)\n- Can be reused (one enzyme molecule can break down many food molecules)\n- Are made of protein themselves",

Humans cannot!\n\n**Example 3: Lactose Intolerance (Common in Singapore)**\n\nSome people cannot digest milk properly.\n\n**What happens:**\n- Milk contains lactose (milk sugar)\n- Normal digestion: Lactase enzyme breaks lactose → glucose + galactose\n- Lactose intolerant people: Don't produce enough lactase\n- Result: Undigested lactose causes bloating, diarrhea, stomach pain\n\n**Why it's common:** Many Asians naturally produce less lactase after childhood.
