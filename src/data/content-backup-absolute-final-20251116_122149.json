Hmm, let me try c = 1 which gives x² - 5x + 4 = 0, discriminant = 25 - 16 = 9 ≠ 0. Actually for x² - 4x + 5 to be touched by x + c, we need discriminant of x² - 5x + (5-c) to be 0.

Find the longest side length to the nearest meter.\n\n**Solution:**\nThird angle = 180° - 42° - 68° = 70° (this is the largest angle). Using sine rule: 500/sin 68° = c/sin 70°, so c = 500 × sin 70° / sin 68° ≈ 538 m\n\n✔ **Final Answer:** 538",

Hydrochloric Acid + Sodium Hydroxide**\n```\nHCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O\n(Acid + Base → Salt + Water)\n```\n- Products: Sodium chloride (table salt) + water\n- The solution becomes neutral (pH 7)\n\n**2. Sulfuric Acid + Magnesium Hydroxide**\n```\nH₂SO₄ + Mg(OH)₂ → MgSO₄ + 2H₂O\n```\n- Products: Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) + water\n- Used in antacid medicine!\n\n**3. Nitric Acid + Potassium Hydroxide**\n```\nHNO₃ + KOH → KNO₃ + H₂O\n```\n- Products: Potassium nitrate (fertilizer) + water\n\n**What Happens During Neutralization:**\n- H⁺ ions from acid + OH⁻ ions from base → H₂O (water)\n- The remaining ions form a salt\n- Heat is released (exothermic reaction)\n- pH moves toward 7 (neutral)\n\n**Real-Life Applications:**\n\n**1. Treating Stomach Acidity (Heartburn)**\n- Problem: Excess stomach acid (HCl) causes pain\n- Solution: Take antacid tablet (contains base like Mg(OH)₂)\n- Reaction: HCl + Mg(OH)₂ → MgCl₂ + H₂O\n- Result: Acid neutralized, pain relief\n\n**2. Treating Insect Stings**\n\n**Bee Sting** (acidic venom):\n- Apply baking soda paste (base)\n- Base neutralizes the acid\n- Reduces pain and swelling\n\n**Wasp Sting** (basic venom):\n- Apply vinegar (acid)\n- Acid neutralizes the base\n- Reduces pain and swelling\n\n**3. Agriculture - Soil Treatment**\n\n**Acidic Soil** (bad for some plants):\n- Add lime (calcium hydroxide - base)\n- Neutralizes excess acid\n- Improves plant growth\n\n**Basic Soil** (bad for other plants):\n- Add sulfur (forms acid when wet)\n- Neutralizes excess base\n- Better growing conditions\n\n**4. Industrial Waste Treatment**\n- Factory waste may be very acidic or basic\n- Add opposite substance to neutralize\n- Make waste safe before releasing to environment\n\n**5. Toothpaste**\n- Bacteria in mouth produce acids\n- Acids damage tooth enamel\n- Toothpaste contains mild bases\n- Neutralizes acids, protects teeth\n\n**Singapore Context:**\n\n**1. PUB Water Treatment**\n- Adjusts pH of water supply\n- Uses bases to neutralize acidic water\n- Ensures safe drinking water (pH ~7)\n\n**2. Swimming Pools**\n- Need to maintain pH 7.2-7.8\n- Add acid if too basic\n- Add base if too acidic\n- Keeps water safe and comfortable\n\n**3. Cooking**\n- If curry is too sour (acidic), add a pinch of baking soda (base)\n- Neutralizes excess acid\n- Balances flavor\n\n**Signs of Neutralization:**\n- Temperature increases (gets warmer)\n- Bubbling may occur\n- Color change if indicator present\n- pH moves toward 7",

In the early morning or late afternoon, the sun is lower, so your shadow is much longer.\n\nWhy? Light travels in straight lines from the sun. When the sun is high, light rays come almost straight down. When the sun is low, light rays come at an angle, creating a longer shadow.\n\n**Example 2: Solar Eclipse**\n\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking sunlight. Because light travels in straight lines:\n\n- The Moon casts a shadow on Earth\n- People in the umbra (dark central shadow) see a total solar eclipse\n- People in the penumbra (lighter outer shadow) see a partial solar eclipse\n- People outside the shadow see no eclipse\n\n**Singapore Context:**\nThe last time Singapore experienced a partial solar eclipse was on December 26, 2019. The next one will be visible on April 20, 2023. During an eclipse, scientists set up viewing stations at Singapore Science Centre with special solar filters.\n\n**Safety Note:** Never look directly at the sun, even during an eclipse!

Aquarium (Sentosa), the fish appear closer to the glass than they actually are.\n\n**Why?**\n- Light from the fish travels through water, then through thick glass, then into air\n- Each time light crosses a boundary, it refracts\n- The fish's actual position is further back than where you see it\n- This is why it's hard to catch fish with your hands in water!\n\n**Example 4: Sunset Colors**\n\nDuring Singapore's beautiful sunsets over Marina Bay, the sun appears red/orange near the horizon.\n\n**Why?**\n- Sunlight refracts through Earth's atmosphere\n- Blue light scatters more than red light\n- At sunset, light travels through more atmosphere\n- Only red/orange light reaches your eyes\n- This creates stunning Singapore sunsets!\n\n**Practical Application:** Understanding refraction is crucial for:\n- Designing eyeglasses and contact lenses\n- Making camera lenses\n- Fiber optic cables (used in Singapore's ultra-fast internet)\n- Underwater photography",

Sun heats land faster than sea (land has lower heat capacity)\n2. Hot air above land rises (convection)\n3. Cooler air from the sea rushes in to replace it\n4. Result: Cool sea breeze blowing toward land\n\n**At night:**\n1. Land cools faster than sea\n2. Warmer air above sea rises\n3. Cooler air from land moves toward sea\n4. Result: Land breeze blowing toward sea (weaker than sea breeze)\n\n**Singapore context:** This is why coastal areas like Marine Parade feel cooler than central areas like Ang Mo Kio during hot afternoons.\n\n**Example 4: Thunderstorm Formation**\n\nSingapore experiences frequent afternoon thunderstorms, especially during the Southwest Monsoon (June-September).\n\n**How convection causes thunderstorms:**\n\n1. Intense tropical sun heats the ground\n2. Ground heats the air above it\n3. Hot, humid air rises rapidly (strong convection)\n4. Rising air cools as it goes higher\n5. Water vapor condenses, forming clouds\n6. If convection is strong enough, cumulonimbus (thunderstorm) clouds form\n7. Result: Heavy rain and thunder\n\n**Why afternoon storms?** The sun is strongest at midday, creating the most intense heating and convection by afternoon.\n\n**Example 5: Ceiling Fans**\n\nSingapore homes often have ceiling fans to improve comfort.\n\n**How ceiling fans use convection:**\n- Fans don't cool the air, but they create air movement\n- Moving air helps convection by mixing warm air near the ceiling with cooler air near the floor\n- This makes the room feel more comfortable\n- Fans also increase evaporation of sweat from your skin, making you feel cooler",

              "content": "**Example 1: Eating Chicken Rice**\n\n**The rice (carbohydrate):**\n- Mouth: Amylase in saliva starts breaking starch → maltose\n- Small intestine: Amylase continues, then maltase breaks maltose → glucose\n- Glucose absorbed into bloodstream for energy\n\n**The chicken (protein):**\n- Stomach: Pepsin breaks chicken protein → smaller polypeptides\n- Small intestine: Trypsin breaks polypeptides → amino acids\n- Amino acids absorbed into bloodstream for growth and repair\n\n**The oil/skin (fat):**\n- Small intestine: Bile breaks fat into tiny droplets (emulsification)\n- Lipase breaks fat droplets → fatty acids + glycerol\n- Absorbed into lymphatic system, then bloodstream for energy storage\n\n**Example 2: Why We Can't Digest Everything**\n\nWhen you eat vegetables at a hawker center, you might notice some fibers in your feces.\n\n**Why?**\n- Vegetables contain cellulose (a type of carbohydrate in plant cell walls)\n- Humans don't produce cellulase enzyme\n- Without the right enzyme, we can't break down cellulose\n- Cellulose passes through as fiber (actually good for gut health!)\n\n**Interesting fact:** Cows and termites have bacteria in their guts that produce cellulase, so they CAN digest grass and wood. Humans cannot!\n\n**Example 3: Lactose Intolerance (Common in Singapore)**\n\nSome people cannot digest milk properly.\n\n**What happens:**\n- Milk contains lactose (milk sugar)\n- Normal digestion: Lactase enzyme breaks lactose → glucose + galactose\n- Lactose intolerant people: Don't produce enough lactase\n- Result: Undigested lactose causes bloating, diarrhea, stomach pain\n\n**Why it's common:** Many Asians naturally produce less lactase after childhood. This is actually the normal human condition - only some populations (European ancestry) evolved to keep producing lactase into adulthood.\n\n**Solution:** Lactose-free milk or soy milk (no lactose to digest!)",
              "content_zh": "**例子1：吃鸡饭**\n\n**米饭（碳水化合物）：**\n- 口：唾液中的淀粉酶开始分解淀粉→麦芽糖\n- 小肠：淀粉酶继续，然后麦芽糖酶分解麦芽糖→葡萄糖\n- 葡萄糖吸收到血液中用于能量\n\n**鸡肉（蛋白质）：**\n- 胃：胃蛋白酶分解鸡肉蛋白质→较小的多肽\n- 小肠：胰蛋白酶分解多肽→氨基酸\n- 氨基酸吸收到血液中用于生长和修复\n\n**油/皮（脂肪）：**\n- 小肠：胆汁将脂肪分解成微小液滴（乳化）\n- 脂肪酶分解脂肪液滴→脂肪酸+甘油\n- 吸收到淋巴系统，然后血液用于能量储存\n\n**例子2：为什么我们不能消化所有东西**\n\n当你在小贩中心吃蔬菜时，你可能会注意到粪便中的一些纤维。\n\n**为什么？**\n- 蔬菜含有纤维素（植物细胞壁中的一种碳水化合物）\n- 人类不产生纤维素酶\n- 没有正确的酶，我们无法分解纤维素\n- 纤维素作为纤维通过（实际上对肠道健康有益！）\n\n**有趣的事实：**奶牛和白蚁的肠道中有细菌产生纤维素酶，所以它们可以消化草和木头。人类不能！\n\n**例子3：乳糖不耐症（在新加坡很常见）**\n\n有些人不能正确消化牛奶。\n\n**发生了什么：**\n- 牛奶含有乳糖（乳糖）\n- 正常消化：乳糖酶分解乳糖→葡萄糖+半乳糖\n- 乳糖不耐症的人：不产生足够的乳糖酶\n- 结果：未消化的乳糖引起腹胀、腹泻、胃痛\n\n**为什么很常见：**许多亚洲人在儿童期后自然产生较少的乳糖酶。这实际上是正常的人类状况-只有一些人群（欧洲血统）进化为在成年后继续产生乳糖酶。\n\n**解决方案：**无乳糖牛奶或豆浆（没有乳糖可消化！）"

Sexual reproduction**\n- **Meiosis**: Process producing sex cells (gametes)\n- **Random fertilization**: Any sperm can fertilize any egg\n- **Crossing over**: Chromosomes exchange segments during meiosis\n- **Independent assortment**: Chromosomes randomly distributed to gametes\n- **Result**: Each offspring is genetically unique\n\n**2. Mutations**\n- **Definition**: Random changes in DNA sequence\n- **Causes**: Radiation, chemicals, errors during DNA replication\n- **Types**: Gene mutations, chromosome mutations\n\n**Types of mutations:**\n\n**Gene mutations** (affect single genes):\n\n**1. Substitution** - One base replaced by another\n- Example: Sickle cell disease (GAG → GTG in hemoglobin gene)\n- Effect: Abnormal hemoglobin protein, crescent-shaped red blood cells\n\n**2. Insertion** - Extra base added\n- Effect: Reading frame shifts, usually harmful\n\n**3. Deletion** - Base removed\n- Effect: Reading frame shifts, usually harmful\n\n**Chromosome mutations** (affect whole chromosomes):\n\n**1. Deletion** - Segment of chromosome lost\n**2.
