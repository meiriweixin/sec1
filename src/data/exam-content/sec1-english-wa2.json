Research shows that adolescents need between eight to ten hours of sleep per night, yet most teenagers get significantly less. This sleep deficit can have far-reaching consequences on their health, academic performance, and emotional well-being.\n\nDuring sleep, the body undergoes essential repair processes. Growth hormones are released, helping teenagers develop physically. The brain also uses this time to consolidate memories and process information learned during the day. Without adequate sleep, students may struggle to retain what they have studied, leading to poorer academic results.\n\nThe advent of smartphones and social media has exacerbated the sleep crisis among teenagers. Many young people spend hours scrolling through their feeds or playing games late into the night. The blue light emitted by these devices suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep, making it harder to fall asleep. Furthermore, the constant notifications create a fear of missing out, compelling teenagers to stay connected at the expense of their rest.\n\nLack of sleep also affects mood and mental health. Sleep-deprived teenagers are more likely to experience irritability, mood swings, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. They may find it difficult to concentrate in class and are more prone to making poor decisions. Studies have even linked chronic sleep deprivation to increased risk of obesity, as tired individuals tend to crave high-calorie foods.\n\nTo combat this issue, experts recommend establishing a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading a book or taking a warm shower, can signal to the body that it is time to wind down. Most importantly, teenagers should limit screen time before bed and keep electronic devices out of the bedroom.\n\nBy prioritizing sleep, teenagers can improve their overall health, enhance their learning capabilities, and maintain better emotional balance. It is time for both parents and young people to recognize sleep as a non-negotiable component of a healthy lifestyle.",
