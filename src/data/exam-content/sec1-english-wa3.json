Its white walls, once pristine, were now weathered and stained by decades of salt spray and storms. Yet to young Emma, it was the most beautiful building in the world.\n\nEvery summer, Emma would visit her grandfather, the lighthouse keeper, spending long days exploring the rugged shore and listening to his tales of the sea. Grandfather would tell her about the ships he had guided safely through treacherous waters, the fierce storms he had weathered, and the quiet nights when the ocean lay as still as glass beneath a canopy of stars.\n\n\"A lighthouse keeper's job is simple,\" Grandfather would say, his weathered hands wrapped around a cup of hot tea. \"We keep the light burning. No matter what happens, the light must never go out. Sailors depend on it to find their way home.\"\n\nThis summer was different. When Emma arrived, she noticed that Grandfather moved more slowly, his once-strong shoulders now slightly stooped. The stairs to the lamp room, which he used to climb with ease, now left him breathless. Yet his eyes still sparkled when he spoke of his beloved lighthouse.\n\nOne stormy night, the power failed. Emma watched as Grandfather struggled to his feet, determination etched on his face. \"The light,\" he whispered urgently. \"We must keep the light burning.\"\n\nTogether, they climbed the spiral staircase, Grandfather leaning heavily on Emma's shoulder. With trembling hands, he showed her how to light the backup oil lamp, how to adjust the lens so that its beam would reach far out to sea. As the golden light pierced through the darkness, Grandfather smiled, and Emma understood. Some duties transcend age and weakness. Some lights must never be allowed to go out.\n\nYears later, when Emma became the lighthouse's new keeper, she would often think of that night and her grandfather's unwavering dedication. The lighthouse still stands, its beam sweeping across the dark waters, a symbol of hope and guidance for all who sail past.",
