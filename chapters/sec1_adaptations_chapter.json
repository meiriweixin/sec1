        "content": "**Adaptations** are special features that help organisms survive in their environment.\n\n**Key Concept:** Every living thing has adaptations that help it survive where it lives. These features develop over many generations through natural selection.\n\n**Types of Adaptations:**\n\n**1. Structural Adaptations** - Physical features of an organism\n- Polar bear's thick white fur\n- Cactus spines instead of leaves\n- Fish gills for breathing underwater\n\n**2. Behavioral Adaptations** - Actions organisms take\n- Birds migrating in winter\n- Nocturnal animals hunting at night\n- Hibernation during cold months\n\n**3. Physiological Adaptations** - Internal body processes\n- Desert animals producing concentrated urine\n- Snakes producing venom\n- Camels storing fat in humps\n\n**How Adaptations Develop:**\n\nAdaptations develop through **natural selection** over many generations:\n\n1. **Variation** - Organisms in a population have different features\n2. **Competition** - Organisms compete for food, water, shelter\n3. **Survival** - Organisms with helpful features are more likely to survive\n4. **Reproduction** - Survivors pass their features to offspring\n5. **Change** - Over time, helpful features become more common\n\n**Singapore Example:**\n\nThe **smooth-coated otter** (found in Singapore River and reservoirs) has several adaptations:\n- **Webbed feet** for swimming\n- **Waterproof fur** to stay dry\n- **Sensitive whiskers** to detect fish underwater\n- **Strong tail** for steering while swimming\n\nThese features help otters catch fish in Singapore's waterways!",
        "content_zh": "**适应**是帮助生物在其环境中生存的特殊特征。\n\n**关键概念：**每个生物都有帮助它在生活环境中生存的适应。这些特征通过自然选择在许多代中发展。\n\n**适应类型：**\n\n**1. 结构适应** - 生物的物理特征\n- 北极熊的厚白毛皮\n- 仙人掌的刺而非叶子\n- 鱼的鳃用于水下呼吸\n\n**2. 行为适应** - 生物采取的行动\n- 鸟类在冬季迁徙\n- 夜行动物在夜间狩猎\n- 在寒冷月份冬眠\n\n**3. 生理适应** - 内部身体过程\n- 沙漠动物产生浓缩尿液\n- 蛇产生毒液\n- 骆驼在驼峰中储存脂肪\n\n**适应如何发展：**\n\n适应通过**自然选择**在许多代中发展：\n\n1. **变异** - 种群中的生物具有不同特征\n2. **竞争** - 生物竞争食物、水、庇护所\n3. **生存** - 具有有用特征的生物更有可能生存\n4. **繁殖** - 幸存者将其特征传给后代\n5. **变化** - 随着时间推移，有用的特征变得更常见\n\n**新加坡例子：**\n\n**江獭**（在新加坡河和蓄水池中发现）有几种适应：\n- **蹼足**用于游泳\n- **防水毛皮**保持干燥\n- **敏感的胡须**在水下探测鱼\n- **强壮的尾巴**用于游泳时转向\n\n这些特征帮助水獭在新加坡的水道中捕鱼！"
