It allows us to transform a complex integral into a simpler one.\n\n**Key Formula:**\nIf u = g(x), then ∫f(g(x))g'(x) dx = ∫f(u) du\n\n**Steps for substitution:**\n1. Identify the inner function u = g(x)\n2. Find du/dx and rearrange to get dx in terms of du\n3. Substitute both u and dx into the integral\n4. Integrate with respect to u\n5. Substitute back to express answer in terms of x\n\n**Example: Singapore MRT expansion**\n\nThe rate of construction of a new MRT line (in meters per day) is modeled by v(t) = 2t(t² + 1)³, where t is time in months. To find the total length constructed, we integrate:\n\n∫2t(t² + 1)³ dt\n\nLet u = t² + 1, then du/dt = 2t, so du = 2t dt\n\nThe integral becomes: ∫u³ du = u⁴/4 + C = (t² + 1)⁴/4 + C\n\nThis technique is essential for Singapore's infrastructure planning and construction timelines."
