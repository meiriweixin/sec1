Good presentations: 1) Clear title on each slide, 2) Large text (not tiny!), 3) Few words (use images), 4) Consistent colors/fonts, 5) Animations sparingly. 6-6 rule: Max 6 lines per slide, 6 words per line. Singapore students present projects using slides. Practice speaking skills - don't just read slides! Engage audience with questions, videos, demos."

Example: Track pocket money - Column A: Date, Column B: Amount received, Column C: Amount spent, Column D: Balance (=B-C).
