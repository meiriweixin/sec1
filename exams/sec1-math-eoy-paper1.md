## Answer Key (For Teachers)

### Section A
1. B (17)
2. B ($0.\overline{7}$)
3. C (72)
4. C ($y$)
5. C (9)
6. D (96 cm²)

### Section B
7. (a) $\frac{17}{20}$ (b) $\frac{9}{2}$ or $4\frac{1}{2}$
8. (a) $84 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7$, $126 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 7$, HCF = $2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42$
   (b) $\frac{2}{3}$
9. (a) $4a - 7$ (b) $x^2 - 2x - 15$
10. $x = 9$
11. (a) $65°$ (b) $115°$
12. (a) 26 (b) $T_1 = 1^2 + 1 = 2$ ✓ (c) $n = 13$

### Section C
13. (a) $P = 2(2x + 3) + 2(x - 1) = 6x + 4$ m
    (b) $6x + 4 = 34$, $x = 5$
    (c) Area = $(2(5) + 3)(5 - 1) = 13 \times 4 = 52$ m²

14. (a) Area = $\frac{1}{2}(12 + 8) \times 6 = 60$ cm²
    (b) Various methods acceptable. One approach: Area of $\triangle DEC = 60 - \triangle AED - \triangle BEC$
        Or: Base of $\triangle DEC$ can be found using similar triangles
        Area ≈ 24 cm² (depends on exact position interpretation)
    (c) $\frac{2}{5}$
