## Marking Scheme Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Method Marks (M)**: Awarded for correct approach even if final answer is wrong
2. **Accuracy Marks (A)**: Awarded for correct final answers
3. **Bonus Marks (B)**: Occasionally given for exceptional solutions

### Specific Guidelines

- **Show Working**: Questions requiring working get 0 marks for answer-only responses
- **Units**: Penalize missing or wrong units in mensuration questions
- **Significant Figures**: Unless specified, accept 3 s.f. or exact answers
- **Equivalent Forms**: Accept equivalent algebraic expressions
- **Graph Tolerance**: Allow ±1 small square for graph questions
