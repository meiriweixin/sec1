## Answer Key (For Teachers)

### Section A
1. A (35)
2. B (3)
3. A ($x < 4$)
4. C (40°)
5. C ($(0, -3)$)

### Section B
6. (a) 21, 25 (b) $T_n = 4n + 1$ (c) Yes, when $n = 25$
7. (a) $x \leq 3$ (b) $-2 < x \leq 4$
8. (a) 2 (b) $y = 2x + 1$ (c) $(-\frac{1}{2}, 0)$
9. (a) Alternate angles (b) 72° (c) 108° (d) 360°
10. (a) $y = 60°$ (b) $x = 55°$ (c) Isoceles triangle

### Section C
11. (a) $F = 3.90 + 0.25 \times \frac{d \times 1000}{400} = 3.90 + 0.625d$
    (b) $\$8.90$ (c) 18.4 km (d) 8.8 km

12. (a) Pattern 3: 10, Pattern 4: 13, Pattern 5: 16
    (b) $T_n = 3n + 1$
    (c) Pattern 33
    (d) No, because $50 = 3n + 1$ gives $n = 16\frac{1}{3}$, which is not a whole number

13. (a) Trapezium (or trapezoid)
    (b) $(2x + 10) + (x + 30) = 180$ (This is incorrect - should use co-interior with parallel sides)
    Correct: $\angle DAB + \angle ABC = 180°$ (co-interior angles)
    So $110 + (2x + 10) = 180$, giving $x = 30$
    (c) $x = 30$
    (d) $\angle BCD = 30 + 30 = 60°$, and $y + 60 = 180°$ (co-interior), so $y = 120°$
    (e) $110 + 70 + 60 + 120 = 360°$ ✓
